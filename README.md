# Cybersecurity Network Scanning Project

This project demonstrates practical hands-on cybersecurity skills using Linux tools:

## Tools Used
- **Nmap** – Network scanning, OS detection, service enumeration  
- **Wireshark** – Packet analysis, DNS inspection, traffic monitoring  
- **Linux (Ubuntu)** – Terminal commands, network interfaces, IPv4/IPv6  
- **Local Network Reconnaissance**

---

## What I Performed
- Detected all active devices in the local network  
- Identified OS types (macOS, iPhone, Linux router, etc.)  
- Collected open ports and running services  
- Analyzed DNS packets from browser activity  
- Understood IP addressing (Private vs Public vs Loopback)

---

## Project Files
- `README.md` – Documentation  
- Network scan screenshots  
- Wireshark captured data (DNS packets)

---

## Purpose
This project is part of my **cybersecurity learning journey** and demonstrates foundational skills in:

- Network mapping  
- Reconnaissance  
- Packet analysis  
- System fingerprinting  

---

## Future Improvements
- Automate scans using Bash  
- Add Python scripts for parsing Nmap results  
- Expand Wireshark analysis

---

Made with  using Ubuntu & Nmap.
